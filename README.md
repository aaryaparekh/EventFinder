# EventTracker

Event finder is a website that strengthens local communities by allowing people to announce events (such as garage sales, fundraisers, etc.) that they are hosting. Users can find events happening in real-time within their local vicinity and also view future events. Our target demographic is for people looking for interesting events in an impromptu fashion. A map view gives a location-first approach to finding things to do by prioritizing events closest to you. A separate view lets users see events happening in the future, allowing a more planned, traditional approach to creating an itinerary. Our application also gives power to small businesses and organizations in a local community to announce their presence. For example, a local coffee store can announce their attendance to the weekend farmers market, or a UCSC club can display their pop-up fundraiser in front of the Science and Engineering library. 

The navbar is on the top of the page and has a Home button for users to go back to the main page from wherever they are and then a My Events button that redirects users to the my_events page to view and edit events they created. It also has our logo on the left and if users are signed in, then it will display their email and a button to sign out. If they are not signed in, then a button to sign in with google will appear which makes signing in easy and fast. The main page is where users can browse events happening in their area. Users donâ€™t have to be signed in for them to view. However, to create events and view them, users must be signed in. There is a map on the left side of the page and a list of events on the right with a search bar. Events can be filtered and there is also a button to clear the filters.
